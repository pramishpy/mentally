3D Models Directory for Mentally Project

This directory should contain the following .glb model files:
- anxiety_visualization.glb
- depression_visualization.glb
- breaking_stigma.glb
- mental_health_awareness.glb
- calming_exercise.glb
- mood_lifting.glb
- community_support.glb

For development purposes, you can use placeholder models or create simple models using tools like:
- Blender (https://www.blender.org/)
- Microsoft's 3D Builder
- Online tools like Sketchfab

Models should be optimized for web/mobile viewing with:
- Low polygon count (ideally under 50k triangles)
- Compressed textures
- Total file size under 5MB per model for fast loading

When deploying to production, consider hosting larger models on a CDN for better performance.
