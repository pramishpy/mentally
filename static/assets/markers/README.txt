# AR.js Marker Files

This folder contains the pattern (.patt) files used for the AR experiences.

## How to create your own marker pattern files:

1. Visit the AR.js Marker Training tool at: https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/

2. Upload a simple black and white image (preferably with high contrast)

3. Click "Generate" button to create your pattern file

4. Download the .patt file and place it in this folder

5. Update the arExperiencesConfig in ar-experience.js to use your new marker file

## Tips for effective markers:

- Use simple, high-contrast images
- Avoid symmetrical patterns (the marker should look different from different angles)
- Square markers work best
- Text with distinct characters works well
- Make sure to print markers at adequate size (at least 3x3 inches)
